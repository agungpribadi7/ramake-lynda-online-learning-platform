The stakes are high, but a well-rounded data governance process can help ensure the consistent quality, availability, integrity, and usability of your data.

Here Dr. Jonathan Reichental explains how to begin to implement a data governance program within any organization. Learn the components of data governance, its strategic value, the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and the overall steps that an organization needs to take to manage, monitor, and measure the program. Plus, get guidance on a set of next steps for building skills. As the data science domain grows, so does the demand for data governance expertise. Start here for your first look at this in-demand skill.@@@Jonathan Reichental@@@289.26@@@20###99@@@Data Science@@@Big Data@@@Architecting Big Data Applications: Real-Time Application Engineering@@@Real-time systems have guaranteed response times that can be sub-seconds from the trigger. Meaning that when a user clicks a button, your app better respond??and fast. Architecting applications under real-time constraints is an even bigger challenge when you're dealing with big data. Excessive latency can cost you money, in terms of system resources consumed and customers lost. Luckily, big data technology and efficient architecture can provide the real-time responsiveness your business needs. In this course, you can learn about use cases and best practices for architecting real-time applications with technologies such as Kafka, Hazelcast, and Apache Spark.
